On the evening of 13 November 2015, a series of coordinated terrorist attacks—consisting of mass shootings, suicide bombings, and hostage-taking—occurred in Paris, France, and Saint-Denis, one of its northern suburbs. Beginning at 21:16 CET,[15] six mass shootings and three separate suicide bombings near the Stade de France occurred.[15][16] The deadliest attack was at the Bataclan theatre, where attackers took hostages and engaged in a stand-off with police which ended at 00:58 on 14 November.

The attacks killed 129 victims,[2][17] 89 of them at the Bataclan theatre.[4][18][19][20] A further 415 were admitted to hospital with injuries sustained in the attacks, including 80 people described as being seriously injured.[21] In addition to the victims, seven attackers were killed, and the authorities continued to search for any accomplices remaining at large.[3] France had been on high alert since the January 2015 attacks in Paris that killed 17 people, including civilians and police officers.[7] French President François Hollande announced a state of emergency, the first since the 2005 riots,[22] and placed temporary controls on the country's borders.[18]

On 14 November, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL or ISIS) claimed responsibility for the attacks.[6][23][24] Their motive was retaliation for French involvement in the Syrian Civil War and Iraqi Civil War.[13][25] President Hollande said the attacks were organised from abroad by ISIS,[26] "with internal help",[27] and described them as "an act of war".[28] The attacks were the deadliest in France since the Second World War,[29][30] and the deadliest in the European Union since the Madrid train bombings in 2004.[22]
